# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Dashboard
This project presents an interactive Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard built entirely using Microsoft Excel. The dashboard provides a comprehensive monthly report on emergency room activity, offering visual insights into patient flow, wait times, demographics, and referrals.

It was created as part of a learning exercise to understand and apply data analysis and visualization techniques in Excel, especially focused on a healthcare environment.
